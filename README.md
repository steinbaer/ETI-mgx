# ETI-mgx
Project and script repository for "Longitudinal effects of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor on the oropharyngeal metagenome in children with cystic fibrosis"

## Scripts
### Bash scripts
- Quality control of sequencing fastqc / multiqc
- Remove Human reads with bbmap
- MetaPhlAn4
- StrainPhlAn4
### R scripts
- alpha-diversity, beta-diversity and differential abundance
- StrainPhlAn trees
- StrainPhlAn clusteriing and mutation rates

## Data
Raw sequencing data (after human read removal) have been stored accessible for the public in the NCBI bioproject repository (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/ with the accession code “PRJNA1019921”). Study participant and further metadata is available upon reasonable request.
